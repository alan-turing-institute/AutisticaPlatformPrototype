        <h1>Welcome to the Open Humans App Demo/Dev site</h1>
        <p>
          This project is intended for testing, development, and demonstration
          of the reusable Django app for working with Open Humans,
          <a href="https://github.com/OpenHumans/django-open-humans">django-open-humans</a>.
        </p>

      <div class="row">

          <p>
            Configure this app by copying the <code>env.sample</code> file to
            <code>.env</code> and setting these as needed. <b>You will need to
            create a project in Open Humans</b> to get a "Client ID" and
            "Client secret" for your own project, and put these in your local
            <code>.env</code> file.
          </p>
          <p>
            The code for this site can be found on Github at:

            You're welcome to use it as a template or reference for how a
            Django-based website can connect and interact with Open Humans
            member accounts.
