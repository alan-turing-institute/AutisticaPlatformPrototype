# Open Humans Community Code of Conduct
Adopted Feb 23 2017, adapted from mozilla.org policies, shared under a Creative Commons license (CC-BY-SA 3.0).
* **Be respectful.** Disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. We will all experience some frustration now and then, but we don’t allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. A community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.
* **Try to understand different perspectives.** Our goal should not be to “win” every disagreement or argument. A more productive goal is to be open to ideas that make our own ideas better. “Winning” is when different perspectives make our work richer and stronger.
* **Do not threaten violence.**
* **Empower others to speak.**
* **Strive for excellence.** For our products to be great our communities must be healthy and vigorous. Being respectful does not mean papering over disagreements or accepting less than we can do.
* **Don’t expect to agree with every decision.**

## Diversity and Inclusion
* Open Humans welcomes and encourages participation by everyone. It doesn’t matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you: we welcome you. We welcome contributions from everyone as long as they interact constructively with our community, including, but not limited to people of varied age, culture, ethnicity, gender, gender-identity, language, race, sexual orientation, geographical location and religious views.
* Open Humans activities should be inclusive and should support such diversity.
* Some Open Humans members may identify with activities or organizations that do not support the same inclusion and diversity standards as Open Humans. When this is the case:
  * (a) support for exclusionary practices must not be carried into Open Humans activities.
  * (b) support for exclusionary practices in outside activities should not be expressed in Open Humans spaces.
  * (c) if (a) and (b) are met, other Open Humans members should treat this as a private matter, not an Open Humans issue.

## Raising Issues Related to Diversity and Inclusion

If you believe you’re experiencing practices which don’t meet the terms outlined above, please contact us at support@openhumans.org. Intentional efforts to exclude people from Open Humans activities are not acceptable and will be dealt with appropriately. If unintentional exclusion or misunderstandings occur, we will figure out how to make it not happen again.
