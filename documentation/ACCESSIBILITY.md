**User Interface**

Define the purpose of a User Interface - Core Sections
UI is the “face” of the project and plays a vital part for its success, it defines the user experience. Good user experience can make people like the tool, while inadequate user experience can make people dislike and abandon the tool despite its benefits.

**User Interface Research:**

Autistica Main Website User Interface Component Research
Open Humans & Molehill Mountain User Interface Component Research
Open Humans User Interface Component Research

To create an account the user has to first access the home page of the Open Humans platform then create an open humans login. Given this user journey it is  important to create some subtle component relationship between the platforms - home page and open humans login - this has been achieved through the use of a Call To Action, font Montserrat, and use of a similar neutral grey background colour which is easy on the eye and calming.

These elements help create a visual connection between this interaction, adds clarity and creates a more seamless interaction for the user.

The accessibility features will aid and increase autistic peoples participation in the research. The simply design has helped to reduce sensory overload and allowed the platform be inclusive for all. The platform supports the capturing of experiences of autistic people and others.

The importance of designing for autistic people using methods of customisability is evident. The accessibility menu uses a suitable, interface  where the colour, font size, medium of communication (auditory, visual, textual) can be chosen and altered to the users requirements.

It is clear that the one-size-fits-all-approach will not work for the community and inclusive design needs (accessibility best practice) to be used throughout the platform.

We are building a new online tool to help improve environments for autistic people. Clear embedding of digital accessibility in the project, whilst  adhering to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 AA standard, published by (W3C).

The platform enables a user to open a set of page with an autism friendly interface. The interface has been built using simple colours, platforms content is written in plain English, using simple sentences and bullet points. The build has used simple consistent layouts. The design (clean, white space, steppers etc) enables the users to be able to drill down on initial selections which need actions. The reduced busyness of the interface has also enabled this process.

The wire framing and prototyping focus is for a laptop device. However wireframes have been completed which cover all web-based devices including phones, iPad and large screens.

UI Design Recommendations for People with Autism Spectrum Disorder ASD Paper
UI design recommendations follow the guidelines set forth by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) through the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) to improve web access to people with disabilities by means of the concept of “inclusive design”. These recommendations aim to improve accessibility (which develops the efficacy of the tool) and usability (which increases its efficiency) and establish the ideal interaction and interdependence between the different components of the web development (i.e. content, web browser, assistive technology, user, developer, authoring tools and evaluation tools).

**The findings described in this paper enable us define the following requirements for UI for people with ASD:**
Avoid deep hierarchies
Reduce memory load
Avoid multiple focuses of attention
WCAG 2.1: 118 checkpoints covering A, AA & AAA W3 accessibility guidelines
Disabilities like ADHD and Autism can cause difficulty in handling impressions, sorting information and sensitivity to sound
Give the website a simple and clean design
Avoid having too much content on the same page
Offer image, audio and video alternatives to text content

**Presentation**
**Do:**
Use contrast between font and background.
Use soft, mild colours
Make sure text box is clearly separated from the rest
Present text in a single column

**Navigation & Page Loading**
**Do:**
Strive for simple, clear navigation.
Indicate on each page clearly where the user is.
Support navigation with mouse or keyboard.
Allow the use of browser’s buttons.
Pages should load fast.
Use visual indicators for time-consuming actions.
Have a Help button.

**Colour Blindness Thinking (Linked to Access Menu)**

Never rely on colour alone to convey functional meaning
Outline tabs with a border
Good contrast - use of highly saturated red against lighter green
Combine use of colour, words, and symbols for examples Yes and No
Some people cannot read text if there is not sufficient contrast between the text and the background. For others, bright colours (high luminance) are not readable; they need low luminance.  This is covered in the accessibility menu settings.

Unique Styles for different link states - style links to stand out from the text. The use of perimeter border outlining icons and text makes elements appear as buttons which increases apprehension. All buttons in the UI should look like buttons other wise they lose perceived affordance.
