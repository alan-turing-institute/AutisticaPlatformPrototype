**Linkage between Wireframes Components & Prototype Code (html/css)**

The relationship between the .html componetns and .css (class) locations has been defined in the .md 
https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaPlatformPrototype/blob/documentation/documentation/CLASSLOCATION.md
to aid clarity.

The platform prototype code (templates .html & .css) for the project can be accessed at via the Skeleton folder:

**Core Page Components**

![alt text](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaPlatformPrototype/blob/documentation/images/2_core.png)

**Header**

Responsive full length white strip across the top of the page with the logo.

Each component has a clear single focus, the placement of the components (logo and navigational page links) is clean and simple.


**Logo**

The logo is Autistica Positive logo version 134 X 79 px which sits flush on the sub-header section.


![alt text](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaPlatformPrototype/blob/documentation/images/3_nav.png)

**Navigation Bar**

The navigation is clear and links to the platforms main sections, represented as menu links. This is consistent from one web page to another. Clearly separated to aid screen readers and general accessibility.

Clear way-finding indicates where the user is on each page using this clear, simple navigation.

The platforms navigation is presented here and is aligned to the right. The navigation stays the same from one webpage to another. The navigation links are descriptive, the language used to describe the page links are plain and accessible. The use of single page links avoids deep hierarchies.

The navigation links are larger than standard websites at 22px and use the font Acumin Pro using the colour #00A590. The platform links are equally spread out, spacing at 52px for the displayed view 1200px. The font Acumin Pro has been chosen as a good example of a rounded sans serif font, which has enough space between letters is suitable from an accessibility perspective.

The Contrast Ratio is 4.69:1 using webaim.org  contrast checker for the mint green text, foreground with the white background colour. WCAG 2.0 level AA requires a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text. WCAG 2.1 requires a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 for graphics and user interface components (such as form input borders). The Ratio passes the contrast ratio.


**Sub-Headers**

The top, light mint green #E8F6F4 strip is  a container for the platforms strap line which can be interchangeable based on page template messaging. With a height of 56px.

The strap line uses the font Dolly Pro  dark grey #1D1D1D at 36px. Dolly Pro is the second typefaces the site uses. The platform is restricted to the use of only two fonts, Dolly Pro & Acumin Pro.


**Call To Action**

![alt text](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaPlatformPrototype/blob/documentation/images/17_upload_CTA.png)

The layout focuses on initial CTA, login to begin which has a descriptive title.

The button also has a border green highlight to it. The button is 397 X 62px. It has 6px rounded corners and is green (#00A590). The title uses Acumin Pro, Bold 24px in white.

**Aims**

![alt text](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaPlatformPrototype/blob/documentation/images/7_aims.png)

All of the main section titles on the page are Acumin Pro, Bold 24px Simple sentences and grey bullet points (#666666) 10px X 10px have been used to present the platforms aims.  One sentence is presented on one line to aid clarity for the community.  The sentences use 22px base font Acumin Pro, Light 22px in a dark grey (#666666).

Green (#2DFC30) highlighting applied to content sections and given content as recent feedback from the community.


**Steppers**

![alt text](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaPlatformPrototype/blob/documentation/images/10_stepper.png)

Indicates on each page user function page, defines where the user is using Way finding techniques.


**Newsletter**

![alt text](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaPlatformPrototype/blob/documentation/images/11_newsletter.png)

Uses main section title Acumin Pro, Bold 24px. Provides simple instructions for the user. Enter your email address. With a start CTA Subscribe button to the right as standard CTA.

**How it works** 

![alt text](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaPlatformPrototype/blob/documentation/images/9_how_it_works.png)

This component is an example of an open accordion. 

Uses main section title Acumin Pro, Bold 24px. Provides simple instructions for the user. A solid icon is also using Mint Green #00A590 / 36 W/H px. A animated drop down arrow icon is also shown which is the same colour and has the same dimensions, which is reversed depending when the accordion is open or closed.

A Green (#2DFC30) highlight is applied to the content in this sections from recent feedback from the community to highlight text. 

Simple sentences are used, with, grey bullet points (#666666) 10px X 10px underneath have been used to present how the platform works.  One sentence is presented on one line to aid clarity for the community.  The sentences use 22px base font Acumin Pro, Light 20px in a dark grey (#666666).

Green (#2DFC30) highlighting applied to content sections and given content as recent feedback from the community.

A image of the process is shown to the right of this content box.


**Language Selector**

![alt text](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaPlatformPrototype/blob/documentation/images/12_lang_selector.png)

Research indicates that a commonly recognised icon globe (Ikea etc) can be used as a suitable icon for changing the country language selector.

The use of a clear radio button allows the user to make a clear single selection of a given language.

The full language name has been used to represent given languages.

A perimeter border has been added to the component which outlines the icons and text. Making this component appear like a button increases apprehension. All buttons in the UI should look like buttons other wise they lose perceived affordance.


**Profile**

![alt text](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaPlatformPrototype/blob/documentation/images/13_profile.png)

This is the first page the user sees after they are logged in using the Open Human login process.

The user is presented with a short set of instructions for the profile task, which, are provided after the sub header.

Good contrast used for Yes / No Inputs. The Yes / No Inputs combine use of colour, words, and icons.

All of the main section titles on the page are Acumin Pro, Bold 24px Simple sentences and grey bullet points (#666666) 10px X 10px have been used to present the platforms aims.  One sentence is presented on one line to aid clarity for the community.  The sentences use 20px base font Acumin Pro, Light 20px in a dark grey (#666666).

Green (#2DFC30) highlighting applied to content sections and given content as recent feedback from the community.

The Profile set of questions enable the user to set there profile based on a series of clear questions. Providing information in small bites for the user.

This platform especially the Profile page has been Co-designed with the autistic community and their families. This page was developed from user experience feedback gathered to date


**Landing Page**

This is the main content area in the centre of the page that contains the unique content of a given webpage. This varies from page to page based on its function.

The page provides simple instructions for the user in the page introduction, descriptions.

Presents a series of steps.

**Content Boxes / Accordions**
</br>

![alt text](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaPlatformPrototype/blob/documentation/images/18_accordian.png)

The layout is consistent, the content boxes and the accordions help to break down the content into small blocks of digestible information, with a focus on hierarchy - CTA (login to begin) - Followed by a series of accordions.

How it Works is in a open status, followed by Configure & Get Involved. 

The accordions and content boxes are clearly framed with a mint green border to them. This helps to provide a single point of focus for the user.


**Experience (Share)**

![alt text](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaPlatformPrototype/blob/documentation/images/14_share.png)

Headings are used as a navigational aids on the functions.

Short instruction provided on each step of the input boxes.

The information has been laid out in small consistent blocks, with each of the pages components having a clear single focus. The experience page information is divided into manageable groups of information covering the inputting of Location / Experience / Different.

Adoption of colour words for Where, What, How. The page uses simple colours.

Image, audio and video as alternative means of experience input are uploaded using the media upload.

The content is written in plain english, using simple sentences.

The buttons are descriptive, with emphasis being created using bold text.

A series of sectioned input boxes (questions) are provided to input into, reducing the level of complexity on the page. Difficulties are presented in the framing of the experience questions, as some autistic people, will find it hard to explain elements of their experience. The structure of the questions with guidance questions aids the framing and understanding for the user.

The sensory drop down boxes in the experience question box, allows the user to focus on a selection of sensory environments.

The option of adding experiences in writing, voice recordings, photograph’s and videos uploading is provided as part of the media upload function.

This series of options, combines written feedback, media upload and non-verbal input, which makes the platform more accessible to non-verbal people.

The positioning of input boxes is logical and sequential. The experience page has the option to “Save for later” which was stated as important. The experience page doesn’t take too long to fill in.

The location input will allow the community to review given places.

During the process of adding experience, if inactive an alert message will  be presented if inactive for an extended period.

The help feature is also provided to nudge the user at given intervals as required and to provide further instruction as required.

**Alerts**

![alt text](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaPlatformPrototype/blob/documentation/images/15_alert.png)

To indicate the level of severity
Use of alert messaging with text prefixes and icons
Use of size, colour and iconography
High attention alert
https://4nhf3w.axshare.com/#g=1&p=8-alerts-research

**List View**

![alt text](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaPlatformPrototype/blob/documentation/images/16_list_view.png)

The experience is presented in a list view.
The experiences has a ID number, the Date is also shown.
The experience input presents the location, experience and different and is structured as individual experiences.

**Experience  Viewer**

These experiences can be viewed, allowing the user to toggle easily between public and private experiences and two presentation views list / table. The clear option is provided for the user to share, “Are you sure you want this made public?” check box.

The language used is literal and clear as possible.  With a minimal use of metaphor being used on this page and through-out the platform.


**Access Icon**

![alt text](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaPlatformPrototype/blob/documentation/images/19_access_logo.png)


The platform allows for customisation via the accessibility menu (standing person with outstretched arms)  the access icon is titled, Access the icon is 48px X 48px in dark grey #1D1D1D.

The accessibility menu panel capitalises on multi-sensory uses (screen reader etc) as does the functionality of the experience page (media upload and non-verbal)

**Footer** 

![alt text](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaPlatformPrototype/blob/documentation/images/22_footer.png)

**Sub Footer**

Full page width strip, the dark green (#00444F) strip has a height of 102px. This could be expanded to combine contact info and links to other key information about the platform.

**Bottom Footer**

Full page width strip, the dark grey (#1D1D1D) strip has a height 54px along the bottom and contains a centred copyright notice in Acumin Pro 14px light blue colour (#DDF9FF).

**Return to the top icon**

The use of an arrow to indicate the user can return to the top of the page.

This button takes the form of a coloured circle and has a arrow up icon combined with the action title back to top (ref TKMaxx etc)
